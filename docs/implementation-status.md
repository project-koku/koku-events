## Detailed Breakdown

### CRITICAL Requirements

### POC-ENV — On-Premise Deployment
**Status:** Partial
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#poc-env](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#poc-env--on-premise-deployment)

CRC deployment is documented and tested. Full RHCM on-prem (Helm/OLM)
is a separate concern owned by the RHCM team.

| Step | Status | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| CRC deployment checklist | Done | [crc-full-deployment.md) 
| Full stack guide (OSAC + consumer + DB) | Done | [crc-full-deployment.md](dev/crc-full-deployment.md) |
| Deployment plan (CRC → production path) | Done | [crc-full-deployment.md](dev/crc-full-deployment.md) |
| RHCM Helm chart / OLM | Not started | RHCM team scope |

---

### POC-ARCH — Capacity-Based Charging Model
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#poc-arch](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#poc-arch--capacity-based-charging-model)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Costs calculated from provisioned capacity | Done | [`internal/metering/metering.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/metering/metering.go) — `computeInstanceMeters`, `clusterMeters` |
| Heartbeat events drive cost calculation | Done | Watch stream + 60s metering sweep ([ADR-001](decisions/001-metering-sweep-interval.md)) |
| No dependency on workload cluster metrics | Done | All data from OSAC management layer |
| Demo-ready: show cost within SLA | Done | <1ms per event; cost entries within 30s |

**Related docs:** [req1 gap analysis](requirements/req1-osac-integration-gap-analysis.md)

---

### REQ-1 — OSAC Integration via Region Management Cluster
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1--osac-integration-via-region-management-cluster)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Connect to OSAC APIs (gRPC/REST) | Done | [`internal/osac/client.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/osac/client.go) |
| Read inventory and resource state | Done | [`internal/reconciler/reconciler.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/reconciler/reconciler.go) |
| Tenant lifecycle synced | Done | Watch stream + reconciler |
| Workload info includes tenant/project/resource IDs | Done | All inventory records have tenant, project fields |

**Related docs:** [req1 gap analysis](requirements/req1-osac-integration-gap-analysis.md), [gRPC messages catalog](grpc-messages-catalog.md)

---

### REQ-1b — OSAC Heartbeat Event Ingestion
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1b](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1b--osac-heartbeat-event-ingestion)

> **Clarification:** "Heartbeat events" are CloudEvents emitted periodically
> by the OSAC metering collector — same schema as lifecycle events, just fired
> on a timer with pre-calculated `duration_seconds`. Our local 60s metering
> sweep produces functionally identical data. The spec confirms this satisfies
> the requirement. See [ADR-003](decisions/003-heartbeat-emitter-vs-sweep.md).

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Receive periodic lifecycle CloudEvents via HTTP | Done | [`internal/api/handler.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/api/handler.go) — `POST /api/v1/events` |
| Parse tenant/project/resource/hardware/duration | Done | MaaS CloudEvents parsed; VM data via Watch stream |
| First event auto-creates tenant/project | Done | `UpsertModel` / `UpsertComputeInstance` create on first event |
| Events processed within SLA | Done | <1ms per event; local sweep every 60s |

---

### REQ-2 — Near-Real-Time Cost Calculation
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2--near-real-time-cost-calculation)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Process events within 60 seconds | Done | <1ms per event |
| End-to-end latency under 90 seconds | Done | Metering: 60s sweep + Rating: 30s sweep |
| Cost report available after processing | Done | `cost_entries` table populated; [`snippets/query-costs.sh`](../snippets/query-costs.sh) |
| Demonstrated with at least one workload | Done | VMs + MaaS models |

---

## HIGH Requirements

### REQ-1a — Cluster Lifecycle via Cluster Orders
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1a](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1a--osac-cluster-lifecycle-via-cluster-orders)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Monitor cluster orders for state changes | Done | We track `Cluster` objects — ClusterOrder is the ordering workflow, the Cluster is the provisioned resource ([resolved](requirements/osac-open-questions.md#cluster-lifecycle-req-1a)) |
| State changes captured | Done | Watch stream CREATED/UPDATED/DELETED |
| Cluster rate configured per cluster order | Done | [`internal/rating/rating.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/rating/rating.go) — `cluster_uptime_seconds`, `cluster_worker_node_seconds` rates |
| Cost based on provisioned capacity + duration | Done | [`internal/metering/metering.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/metering/metering.go) — `clusterMeters` |

---

### REQ-3 — Granular Cost Tracking
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3-granular-cost-tracking)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Cost filterable by tenant | Done | `?group_by=tenant&tenant_id=X` |
| Cost filterable by model/SKU | Done | `?group_by=resource` shows per-resource costs |
| Cost filterable by project | Done | `?group_by=project` — `project_id` on metering + cost entries, wired end-to-end (Jul 4) |
| Cost filterable by user | Done | `?group_by=user` — `user_id` on metering + cost entries (PR #59) |
| Dashboard with near-real-time consumption | Done | Debug dashboard + Grafana |
| Reporting supports CSV and JSON export | Done | `?format=csv`; JSON default |
| Reporting supports date filtering | Done | `?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` params (PR #42) |
| Reporting supports daily resolution | Done | `?resolution=daily` adds date column to cost report (PR #42) |
| Per-resource breakdown | Done | `GET /api/v1/reports/breakdown` — per-resource line-item drill-down (PR #42) |
| Financial data decoupled from infra state | Done | `cost_entries` table independent of inventory |

**Open items (not PoC-blocking):**
- **Application dimension:** No concept of "application" in OSAC — may map to project labels; not in acceptance criteria
- **PII concern:** Pau to confirm whether per-user MaaS attribution needs restriction (open question #21)

---

### REQ-3a — Tenant/Project Attribution
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3a](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3a--osac-tenantproject-attribution)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Cost attributed to correct tenant | Done | `tenant_id` on all metering + cost entries |
| Drill-down to project level | Done | `inventory_project` table; [`internal/inventory/store.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/inventory/store.go) |
| Tenant/project read from OSAC | Done | Reconciler syncs projects |
| Multi-tenant on shared infra | Done | Per-tenant metering and cost isolation |

---

### REQ-8 — Bare Metal Costing
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-8](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-8--bare-metal-costing-osac-bare-metal-service)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Track BareMetalInstance lifecycle | Done | Reconciler polls REST List API; watcher handles events if present |
| Inventory table for bare metal | Done | `inventory_bare_metal_instance` table with catalog_item, state, labels |
| Metering for bare metal | Done | `bm_uptime_seconds` via sweep + final metering on delete |
| Default rates | Done | `bm_uptime_seconds` rate seeded in [`rating.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/rating/rating.go) |

**Note:** BareMetalInstance is not in the public Watch stream oneOf but IS
available via the public REST List API. The reconciler polls periodically
(same pattern as InstanceTypes and Projects). Real-time events available
via the private Watch stream if we switch to it later.

**Open question:** Hardware specs (cores/memory) are not on the
BareMetalInstance proto — they're on the catalog item/template. Currently
metering uptime only. CPU/memory metering requires catalog item → template
resolution (see [OSAC open questions](requirements/osac-open-questions.md#bare-metal-req-8)).

**Related docs:** [req8 gap analysis](requirements/req8-bare-metal-gap-analysis.md)

---

### REQ-9 — Quota/Budget Status API
**Status:** Partial
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-9](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-9--quotabudget-status-api)
**Gap Analysis:** [req9-quota-budget-gap-analysis.md](requirements/req9-quota-budget-gap-analysis.md)

> **Scope expanded in v1.5 (Jul 20):** REQ-9 now requires fleet-level
> status, CRUD API, project→tenant roll-up with no limit overcommit,
> monetary budgets, configurable thresholds, and non-monthly windows.
> All are in scope for Jul 31. See gap analysis for full breakdown.

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only quota status per tenant | Done | `GET /api/v1/quotas/{tenant_id}` with threshold flags and alerts |
| Sub-second latency | Done | Single SUM query with indexes |
| Threshold checks (50/70/90/100%) | Done | `thresholds` map in response; `evaluateThresholds` in rating sweep |
| CRUD API for quota/budget management | Done | `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/quotas` — full CRUD with validation |
| Project-scoped quotas + roll-up to tenant | **Gap** | `project_id` column exists but unused; sums are tenant-only |
| Σ(project limits) ≤ tenant limit | **Gap** | No overcommit validation (Jul 20 decision) |
| Fleet-level status for OSAC | **Gap** | No list-all / cross-tenant endpoint |
| Monetary budgets (cost-based limits) | Done | Budget quotas (unit=USD) use CostSum/TenantCostSum for spend-based limits |
| Non-monthly quota periods (5h, 24h, 7d) | Done | `billing.ResolvePeriod` supports monthly/weekly/daily/Nh/Nd; quota status + threshold evaluation use per-quota period (PRs #68, #74, #76) |
| Configurable thresholds | Done | Per-quota JSONB `thresholds` column; defaults to `[50, 70, 90, 100]` if not set |

---

### REQ-10 — Threshold Notifications to OSAC
**Status:** Done (pull); push parked
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-10](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-10--threshold-notification-back-channel-to-osac)

Pull model shipped: quota API's `thresholds` field returns threshold flags
at 50/70/90/100%. Push/webhook mechanism parked per Jul 2, 2026 decision —
OSAC has no receiver today. Cost can add push support on short notice if
OSAC provides a CloudEvent spec for what they want to receive.

---

### REQ-2a — Cloud Events from OpenShift AI (MaaS)
**Status:** Done (mock)
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2a](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2a--cloud-events-from-openshift-ai-maas)

> **Note:** Previously deferred from PoC; now in-scope per v1.1 spec.

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Receive and process MaaS CloudEvents | Done | [`internal/api/handler.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/api/handler.go) |
| Events ingested within 30 seconds | Done | <1ms per event |
| CloudEvents format parsed and stored | Done | `raw_events` table |
| MaaS cost computed within 60s | Done | Rating sweep every 30s |
| IPP integration (checkBalance + reportUsage) | Done (emulator) | Verified with real IPP plugin (PR #320) + llm-katan echo LLM. [Stress test: 850 req/s](dev/ipp-stress-test-2026-07-05.md) |

**What is verified vs emulated:**
- **Real:** IPP external-metering plugin (PR #320 build), Istio ext_proc
  wiring, our checkBalance and reportUsage endpoints
- **Emulated:** LLM backend (llm-katan echo mode), X-MaaS-* identity
  headers (manually injected, no Authorino)

**MaaS tenant attribution (updated Jul 15):**
- `organization_id` flows end-to-end from MaaSSubscription to `tenant_id`
  on metering entries — verified in
  [tenant attribution experiment](dev/tenant-attribution-experiment-2026-07-08.md),
  merged (PR #39, PR #47)
- Mapping confirmed (Jul 14 meeting): OSAC `cost_center` → Cost `project`;
  OSAC `tenant` → Cost `tenant`
- Noy's upstream PR (adding project/tenant attributes) merged Jul 14;
  Martin's follow-on PR being re-submitted (addressed separately)
- Production Authorino/maas-api auto-injection still pending upstream

**Open questions:**
- It is unclear whether OSAC will add a formal Model entity to the
  fulfillment-service or keep models as identifiers in CloudEvents only.
  Our implementation works either way (see [open question #9](requirements/osac-open-questions.md#maas-req-2a--req-4)).
- MaaS project attribution: subscription vs. model namespace — still
  needs a product decision
- See [MaaS flow](maas-flow.md), [IPP overview](research/ipp-overview.md),
  [k3d deployment guide](dev/k3d-ipp-deployment.md),
  [tenant attribution](research/maas-tenant-attribution.md).

---

### REQ-4 — Token Metering (MaaS)
**Status:** Done (mock)
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2a](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-2a-cloud-events-from-openshift-ai-maas--token-metering)

> **Note:** REQ-4 is tracked as part of REQ-2a in the spec v1.4 and the main status table above. This detailed section is kept for reference.

> **Note:** Previously deferred from PoC; now in-scope per v1.1 spec.

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest token dimensions | Done (mock) | `maas_tokens_in`, `maas_tokens_out` |
| Token data available for cost calculation | Done | Metering entries → cost entries via rating sweep |
| MaaS rate structure defined | Done | Default rates seeded: $0.50/M tokens_in, $1.50/M tokens_out, $5.00/M requests |

---

### REQ-13 — Custom Rate Dimensions
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-13](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-13--custom-rate-dimensions-custom-metrics)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Consume arbitrary CloudEvent dimensions as rate inputs | Done | [`internal/custommetrics/custommetrics.go`](../inventory-watcher/internal/custommetrics/custommetrics.go) — config-driven extraction |
| New dimensions configured with ID, classification, rate name | Done | JSON config file via `CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG` env var |
| Custom dimension data stored and available for cost/reporting | Done | Metering entries flow through existing rating + reporting pipeline |

**Design:** [req13-custom-metrics-design.md](research/req13-custom-metrics-design.md)
**Related Jira:** [COST-3549](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/COST-3549)

**Current status:** Custom metrics still extract and meter raw CloudEvent fields, while the rating path now supports database-backed GoRules for the implemented programmable dimensions (`catalog_item`, `instance_type`, and `tenant_tier`) with static-rate fallback. Cross-meter formulas such as multiplying two independent metering values remain future work. The original [GoRules/Zen spike](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/pull/45) is retained as historical research; see the [rate configuration guide](rate-configuration-guide.md) for the current implementation.

## MUST HAVE Requirements

### REQ-11 — Cost Tiers
**Status:** Done
**Gap Analysis:** [req11-cost-tiers-gap-analysis.md](requirements/req11-cost-tiers-gap-analysis.md)
**Design Proposal:** [req11-cumulative-tiers-design-proposal.md](requirements/req11-cumulative-tiers-design-proposal.md)
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-11](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-11--cost-tiers)

> **Scope expanded in v1.5 (Jul 20):** Three tier modes needed, not two.
> MaaS examples now include time-windowed tiers (e.g. "1M tokens free
> every 5 hours then charge"). Pau confirmed: graduated for PoC,
> monthly accumulation for PoC, per-tenant scope.

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple pricing tiers per resource type | Done | `rates.tiers` JSONB column; `applyTieredRate` waterfall |
| Per-event tiers (within a single MaaS event) | Done | Graduated waterfall works for large events crossing boundaries |
| Capacity cumulative tiers (GiB-month, core-hours) | Done | `tier_mode="cumulative"` + `tier_period`; `ApplyRateCumulative` with `MeteringSumBefore` (PRs #68, #74) |
| Time-windowed MaaS tiers (e.g. every 5h/24h) | Done | Same cumulative engine with `tier_period="5h"` etc.; `ResolvePeriod` supports Nh/Nd (PR #76) |
| Tier config without code changes | Done | JSON in `rates` table; no recompile needed |
| Exact decimal money (not float64) | Done | `shopspring/decimal` for `PricePerUnit`, `CostAmount`, `Tier.PricePerUnit`, wallet balances (PR #84) |

---

### REQ-12 — Daily OpenShift Virtualization Costs
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-12](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-12--daily-openshift-virtualization-costs)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Daily cost per resource | Done | `GET /api/v1/reports/costs?resolution=daily` — adds date column to cost report |
| Hourly or finer granularity | Done | 60s metering sweep + 30s rating sweep; cost entries available within 90s of event |
| Per-project/tenant breakdown | Done | `?group_by=project` or `?group_by=tenant` with `?resolution=daily` |
| Different rates per tenant/project | Done | Per-tenant rate overrides + per-SKU `instance_type` rates |
| CSV/JSON export | Done | `?format=csv` for daily resolution export |

**What we have:** Live queries over `cost_entries` with `?resolution=daily`
give daily (or any date-range) cost per tenant/project/resource. No
pre-aggregated summary table — the query sums `cost_entries` in real time.
This is more flexible than a daily rollup (supports hourly, arbitrary
ranges, any grouping) but may be slower at scale.

**Possible future gaps (not blocking for PoC):**
- **Pre-aggregated daily summary** — if live queries become too slow at
  production scale, a materialized `daily_cost_summary` table could be
  added as a caching layer. The API stays the same; only the query source
  changes.
- **Neocloud per-second granularity** — the spec notes neoclouds doing
  per-minute or per-second billing. Our 60s metering sweep supports
  per-minute naturally. Per-second would need a shorter sweep interval
  (configurable via `METERING_INTERVAL`).

### REQ-14 — Wallets (Prepaid Balance)
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [wallet-spec-draft.md](poc_architecture/boundary_monitoring/wallet-spec-draft.md)
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-14](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-14-wallets-prepaid-balance)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Create, top up, query wallet balances (tenant) | Done | `POST /api/v1/wallets`, `POST .../top-ups`, `GET /api/v1/wallets/{id}` |
| Project-scoped wallets | Deferred | `project_id` column exists; deduction routing not built (stretch) |
| Metered cost deducted as spend accrues | Done | `DeductWallets` runs after every rating sweep; FIFO, partial deduction, resume after top-up |
| Query remaining balance / % remaining | Done | Status API returns `balance`, `remaining_pct`, `balance_status`, `within_balance`, threshold flags |
| Low-balance thresholds trigger alerts | Partial | Threshold flags in pull response; push alerts depend on REQ-10 unparking |
| Wallet operations auditable | Done | `wallet_ledger_entries` table; `GET .../ledger` paginated query |
| Negative adjustments (disputes, corrections) | Done | `AdjustWallet` — modifies balance only, not `reference_balance`; reason field (PR #95) |
| Idempotent top-ups | Done | Duplicate `external_ref` rejected |
| `frozen` lifecycle state | Gap | Spec says "no deductions while frozen" but doesn't define freeze/unfreeze API or rules for top-ups/adjustments — needs product input |
| `reversal` entry type | Gap | Listed in spec schema but semantics undefined |

**Key implementation details:**
- **Decimal precision:** all wallet monetary fields use `shopspring/decimal` (`NUMERIC(18,6)` in Postgres)
- **Wallet IDs:** UUID via `google/uuid`
- **Deduction mechanics:** `cost_entries.wallet_applied` tracks partial deduction; `DeductWallets` respects `balance_floor`; costs for tenants without wallets stay on the postpaid path
- **`reference_balance`:** cumulative total of all top-ups (not adjustments); used as denominator for `remaining_pct = (balance / reference_balance) × 100`

## MEDIUM Requirements

### REQ-3b — Service Catalog Sync from OSAC
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3b](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-3b--service-catalog-sync-from-osac)
**Gap Analysis:** [req3b-instance-type-only-gap-analysis.md](requirements/req3b-instance-type-only-gap-analysis.md)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Read OSAC catalog items | Done | Instance types + 3 catalog item types synced via reconciler |
| Price lists correspond to catalog | Done | `instance_type` dimension on rates table; per-SKU pricing supported |
| Cost calculations use catalog-based rates | Done | Rate lookup: `(tenant, instance_type, resource_type, meter_name)` with 4-way fallback |
| Metering resolves specs from catalog | Done | Catalog fallback: when `cores == 0`, resolves from `InstanceType` catalog |

Catalog items (`inventory_catalog_item` table) synced for all three types:
cluster, compute_instance, bare_metal_instance. Each links to a template
(hardware profile) and carries title, description, published flag.

Three pricing models supported — see [rate configuration guide](rate-configuration-guide.md):
1. **Per-SKU pricing** (flat $/hr per instance_type) — recommended for OSAC
2. **CPU/memory rates** (cores × rate + memory × rate) — traditional model
3. **Per-tenant overrides** — negotiated rates per tenant + instance_type

**Remaining gap:** Catalog item → rate mapping is not automated. Rates
are still seeded as defaults or inserted manually. Future: auto-create
rates from catalog item pricing.

### REQ-5 — Chargeback Reporting
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-5](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-5-chargeback-reporting)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Reports map compute hours + tokens per tenant | Done | `GET /api/v1/reports/costs?group_by=tenant` covers both capacity and consumption cost types |
| Reports per project | Done | `?group_by=project` — `project_id` on cost_entries, wired end-to-end (Jul 4) |
| Per-resource breakdown | Done | `GET /api/v1/reports/breakdown` — per-resource line-item drill-down (PR #42) |
| Date filtering + daily resolution | Done | `?from=&to=` date params, `?resolution=daily` (PR #42) |
| Exportable CSV | Done | `?format=csv` — sets `Content-Type: text/csv` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` |
| Exportable JSON | Done | Koku-compatible envelope: `meta.total` with nested `cost`/`infrastructure`/`supplementary` blocks (PR #42) |
| Consistent with dashboard | Done | Debug dashboard uses same `/api/v1/reports/costs` endpoint |
| Scheduled/periodic export | Done | Documented as [Kubernetes CronJob pattern](dev/scheduled-chargeback-export.md) calling report API; verified on k3d |
| Test coverage | Done | Tests for cost report, daily resolution, breakdown, CSV export (PR #42) |

See also: [`snippets/query-costs.sh`](../snippets/query-costs.sh) for demo queries, [Bruno collection](../bruno-collection/) for interactive testing.

### REQ-7 — Audit Trail
**Status:** Done
**Spec:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-7](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-7--audit-trail)

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Billing ledgers match consumption logs | Done | `raw_events` → `metering_entries` → `cost_entries` — immutable pipeline |
| Tamper-resistant audit trail | Done | `raw_events` table is append-only; [Splunk HEC forwarder](splunk-audit-forwarding.md) streams to Splunk for long-term retention |
| Human-readable error logging | Done | Structured JSON logging via `log/slog`; Splunk search for dispute resolution |

## Future Work (Post-PoC)

| Req | Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [REQ-6](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-6--platform-security--access-control) | Security & Access Control | N/A | In-product, no gap |
| [REQ-12](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-12--daily-openshift-virtualization-costs) | Daily OCP Virt Costs | **Done** | Via live queries (`?resolution=daily`); see detailed section |
| — | RBAC / Access Control for cost data | Not started | Track separately. Insights RBAC (Koku) vs Keycloak (OSAC). See [open question #18](requirements/osac-open-questions.md). Affects REQ-3a and REQ-6. |
